# PiereLv-Task
Here I have created the Main page of the website SparkleHeart.org

The web page I have wrote is for the screens with the width of 1366 pixels.
I tried to do this website responsive as possible.
I used all information from figma and used the material in info page.
Of course this page is not done by professional and that is the reason why I am applying for piere.lv. To become a professional in this IT sphere.
Thank you for the task and waiting for your reply.
